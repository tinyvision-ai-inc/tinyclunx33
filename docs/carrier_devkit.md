# tinyCLUNX33 devkit

The **Devkit** is a carrier for the tinyCLUNX33 SoM that eases product
development and debugging:
A development kit usable as factory programming/test rig.

![tinyCLUNX33 devkit Rev2](tinyCLUNX33_devkit_Rev2_pinout.png)

Features:
- All SoM pins exposed, additional probing and voltage pins
- Inexpensive 4-layer board, compact form-factor
- USB3 at 5 Gbit/s integrated with a Type-C port controller
- GPIO LED and push button
- FTDI chip for JTAG, Flash SPI, UART access over USB

Connectors:
- 2 - USB-C connectors for the FPGA 5 Gbit/s interfaces and FTDI debug
- 2 - QSE expansion connectors for adapter boards (RPi FPC Camera, custom...)
- 1 - SMA connector for the high-speed clock export
- 4 - headers for JTAG, SPI flash, I2C, GPIO
- Extra headers for EN signals and power rails

Mechanical:
- Components on one side with fewer exposed traces at the bottom
- No-tool setup of the SoM helping factory programming
- Mounting holes for securing the board in a rig or enclosure


## Quick Start

These are the instructions to be able to quickly test the
hardware, gateware, and firmware.

This assumes a command line environment:
Linux terminal, Mac OSX terminal, Windows with
[WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) or
[Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win) or
[OSS CAD Suite](https://github.com/YosysHQ/oss-cad-suite-build)'s MinGW or
[Radiant Programmer](https://tinyclunx33.tinyvision.ai/md_som_flash.html#autotoc_md25).

Follow the install instructions from the
[latest release page](https://github.com/tinyvision-ai-inc/tinyclunx33_zephyr_example/releases/latest).

Then, unplug all USB cables to completely power off the board.
Then, connect to the board using a serial console viewer, such as minicom, picocom,
[PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html),
[teraterm](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tera-term/),
or other tool of your preference.

The baud rate depends on the [RTL version]() selected: either `153600` or `192000`, and all other parameters might be left to default.

The serial interface is the 2nd of the FTDI, for instance, on Linux, if the first interface of the FTDI is `/dev/ttyUSB0`, the logs would appear on `/dev/ttyUSB1`:

```
picocom --baud 153600 /dev/ttyUSB1
```

Then, pressing "Enter" should give an access to the Zephyr shell, displaying only `uart:$`.
