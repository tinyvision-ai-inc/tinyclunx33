# Application Notes

This list of documents aims to guide you from reception of the devkit to a working prototype.

- The [Getting Started](https://github.com/tinyvision-ai-inc/tinyclunx33_zephyr_example) guide is only a link to the examples README for now, but complete application notes are underway.
