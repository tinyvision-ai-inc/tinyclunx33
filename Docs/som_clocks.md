# SoM Clocks {#som_clocks}

The FPGA features two internal oscillators and an internal PLL to further
synthesize a clock signal out of the available sources.

An external Si5351A PLL is responsible for generating the differential USB3
reference clock, and has one remaining clock signals free to use.
Clocks are synthesized out of a 25 MHz Crystal Oscillator on the SoM.

The Si5351 PLL can be configured over I2C.
Skyworks provides a generator tool to build the table of I2C registers address
and value for a given clock setup.

## Hardware integration

The USB differential clock generation is already integrated in the SoM.
Here is the description of how it works internally.

The extra free output clock may be looped back to the external input clock pin,
so that the PLL provides a clock with an arbitrary frequency directly to the FPGA.

It is also possible to use the free output clock pin elsewhere on the project.

It is also possible to provide an external input clock source to the FPGA.


## RTL integration

The clocks are already integrated in the RTL.
Here is the description of how it works internally.

The FPGA can use the external input clock, routed to its pin `H8`, which is
a primary clock pin (PCLK), usable for DDR I/O.

The FPGA is able to use the clock signals as a basis for implementing a timer
core.


## Zephyr integration

The timer cores are further providing Zephyr with timers, used for ensuring
a constant system tick interrupt part of RTOS scheduling.

The Si5351 PLL is not yet integrated into Zephyr as a driver. Instead, it is
called from the user code to generate the appropriate clock.

The list of registers to configure over I2C was obtained using the
[vendor tool](https://www.skyworksinc.com/Application-Pages/Clockbuilder-Pro-Software)
in the meantime.

TODO: Integrate the clock tree definition into a Device Tree.

TODO: Write a driver to initialize the PLL and control free clock signal.
